# CSC 337 - Molloy Virtual World Scrabble
Explore the outside of Molloy College in a 3D virtual environment as you play a twist on Scrabble.  Discover hidden objects visible only in the game world, each with its own compelling narrative and musical piece.  Each object's narrative and musical piece plays a part in a larger story and musical composition that evolves in accordance with the order that the objects' names are played on the Scrabble board.  Distinct gameplay can reveal potentially different stories waiting to be told and compositions waiting to be heard.  How many will you unlock?
